# MCPEG Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### Research & Analysis
- ✅ Thoroughly researched MCP protocol specifications
- ✅ Analyzed existing MCP implementations and patterns
- ✅ Identified key architectural requirements
- ✅ Created comprehensive analysis document

### Architecture & Design
- ✅ Designed modular gateway architecture
- ✅ Defined adapter pattern for extensibility
- ✅ Created built-in validation framework design
- ✅ Documented high-level system design

### Technology Decisions (via ADRs)
1. **Go** as implementation language
2. **MCP** as core protocol
3. **API-first** development methodology
4. **YAML** for configuration
5. **REST adapters** as first implementation
6. **Built-in validation** framework

## Key Design Principles

1. **No Redundancy**: Single source of truth for all information
2. **API-First**: Generate code from specifications
3. **Extensibility**: Adapter pattern for new integrations
4. **Self-Validating**: Built-in testing and compliance checking
5. **Production-Ready**: Monitoring, security, and operational features

## Next Steps for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Phase 1)
1. Set up Go development environment
2. Implement basic MCP server with stdio transport
3. Create configuration loader and validator
4. Build adapter interface and mock implementation

### Short Term (Phase 2-3)
1. Implement REST adapter with authentication
2. Add template engine for request/response mapping
3. Build validation endpoints and test mode
4. Create MCP compliance test suite

### Medium Term (Phase 4-5)
1. Add HTTP transport option
2. Implement monitoring and metrics
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Create operational tools

## Configuration Example

```yaml
version: "1.0"
services:
  - id: "example-api"
    type: "rest"
    config:
      base_url: "https://api.example.com"
      auth:
        type: "bearer"
        token: "${API_TOKEN}"
    
    mappings:
      - mcp:
          type: "tool"
          name: "search_items"
        backend:
          method: "GET"
          path: "/items/search"
          query:
            q: "{{.input.query}}"
            limit: "{{.input.limit | default 10}}"
          transform: |
            {
              "items": .results,
              "total": .metadata.total_count
            }
```

## Unique Features

1. **Built-in Validation**: No external CI/CD needed for testing
2. **Generic Design**: Not tied to specific services
3. **Template-Based Mapping**: Flexible request/response transformation
4. **Single Binary**: Easy deployment with Go
5. **MCP Compliance**: Direct generation from official specs

## Questions Resolved

✅ Technology stack: Go
✅ First adapter type: REST
✅ Configuration format: YAML
✅ Testing approach: Built-in validation framework
✅ Development methodology: API-first

## Ready for Implementation

The project is now ready for implementation with:
- Clear architecture and design
- Documented decisions and rationale
- Phased implementation roadmap
- Development guidelines
- Go project structure

The foundation is set for building a lightweight, extensible MCP enablement gateway that bridges the gap between MCP clients and various backend services.
