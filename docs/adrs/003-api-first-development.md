# ADR-003: Adopt API-First Development Methodology

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Building a service that bridges different systems requires clear contracts and interfaces. We need a development approach that:
- Ensures consistency between specification and implementation
- Enables parallel development of different components
- Provides clear documentation for integrators
- Reduces integration errors and misunderstandings

## Decision

We will adopt an API-first development methodology where:
1. API schemas are defined before implementation
2. Code is generated from API schemas to ensure consistency
3. The API schema is the single source of truth
4. All changes start with API schema modifications
5. Implementation follows the generated interfaces

For MCPEG specifically:
- MCP API schemas are generated from official MCP specifications
- Service adapter APIs are designed before implementation
- Configuration schemas are defined in YAML schema before use

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear contracts between components
- Reduced integration errors
- Automatic documentation generation
- Type safety through generated code
- Parallel development of client and server
- Easier testing with mock generation

### Negative

- Additional tooling complexity
- Learning curve for schema-first development
- Upfront design effort required
- Need for code generation pipeline

### Neutral

- Changes require schema updates first
- More formal development process

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Code-First with Documentation**: Rejected because documentation tends to drift from implementation
2. **Manual Interface Definition**: Rejected due to inconsistency risks
3. **Protocol Buffers**: Rejected because MCP uses JSON-RPC, not binary protocols
