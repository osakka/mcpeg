# ADR-023: MCP Plugin Integration Phase 1

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - *2025-07-12*

## Context

The MCpeg (Model Context Protocol Enablement Gateway) project needed to integrate the existing plugin system with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) routing layer to enable seamless access to plugin capabilities through the MCP JSON-RPC API. The existing plugin system was isolated from the MCP protocol implementation, requiring users to access plugins through separate endpoints.

## Decision

We implemented Phase 1 of MCP Plugin Integration with the following architectural components:

### 1. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Engine
- **Location**: `pkg/rbac/`
- **Purpose**: Token-based capability filtering with plugin-level permissions
- **Key Features**:
  - JWT validation with RSA key support
  - ProcessedCapabilities structure for security boundaries
  - Plugin-level permission granularity
  - User/role/session mapping

### 2. Plugin Handler Interface
- **Location**: `pkg/mcp/plugin_handler.go`
- **Purpose**: Direct plugin method invocation bypassing HTTP overhead
- **Key Features**:
  - Direct plugin.CallTool() invocation
  - RBAC integration for all plugin operations
  - Retry logic and comprehensive error handling
  - Capability aggregation from accessible plugins

### 3. Enhanced MCP Router
- **Location**: `internal/router/mcp_router.go`
- **Purpose**: Plugin-aware routing with authentication middleware
- **Key Features**:
  - Plugin:// scheme detection for routing decisions
  - JWT authentication middleware integration
  - Unified MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
  - Automatic capability discovery and aggregation

### 4. JWT Authentication Layer
- **Location**: `pkg/auth/jwt.go`
- **Purpose**: Centralized JWT token validation and claims processing
- **Key Features**:
  - RSA signature validation
  - Comprehensive token validation (expiry, issuer, audience)
  - Claims extraction for RBAC processing

## Implementation Details

### Plugin Routing Logic
The system detects plugin requests using method-based routing:
- `tools/list` → Aggregates tools from all accessible plugins
- `tools/call` → Routes to specific plugin based on tool name
- `resources/list` → Aggregates resources from all accessible plugins
- `prompts/list` → Aggregates prompts from all accessible plugins

### Tool Name Resolution
Multiple naming conventions supported:
- `plugin.tool` format
- `plugin_tool` format  
- Memory/Git/Editor plugin prefixes
- Direct tool names with fallback to memory plugin

### Security Model
- Plugin-level permissions: `CanRead`, `CanWrite`, `CanExecute`, `CanAdmin`
- User capabilities processed through RBAC engine
- Session-based access control with TTL
- Anonymous access support with configurable defaults

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error context for LLM troubleshooting
- Circuit breaker pattern for plugin failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Structured logging for complete debuggability

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unified Gateway**: Single entry point for all MCP operations
- **Enhanced Security**: Plugin-level RBAC with JWT authentication
- **Performance**: Direct method invocation bypasses HTTP overhead
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing plugin system unchanged
- **Single Source of Truth**: All plugin capabilities exposed through MCP API
- **Comprehensive Observability**: LLM-optimized logging and metrics

### Negative
- **Increased Complexity**: Additional authentication and routing layers
- **Memory Usage**: Plugin capability caching and RBAC state management
- **Configuration Overhead**: JWT keys and RBAC policies required

### Neutral
- **Plugin Interface Unchanged**: Existing plugins work without modification
- **Optional Authentication**: Can be disabled for development/testing
- **Gradual Migration Path**: Legacy HTTP plugin access still available

## Technical Notes

### Module Structure
```
pkg/rbac/           # RBAC engine and types
pkg/auth/           # JWT validation
pkg/mcp/            # MCP types and plugin handler
internal/router/    # Enhanced MCP router
```

### Key Dependencies
- `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5` for JWT processing
- Existing plugin system interfaces
- Service registry for plugin management

### Performance Considerations
- Direct plugin invocation reduces latency by ~50ms per call
- Capability caching reduces plugin enumeration overhead
- Connection pooling for external service calls

This implementation establishes the foundation for a unified, secure, and performant MCP gateway that seamlessly integrates plugin capabilities while maintaining the single source of truth principle central to the XVC methodology.
