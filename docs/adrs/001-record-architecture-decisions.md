# ADR-001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - *2025-07-11*

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:
- Maintain a historical record of why decisions were made
- Help new team members understand the project's evolution
- Avoid revisiting the same discussions
- Document trade-offs and alternatives considered

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard to record all significant architectural decisions. ADRs will be:
- Stored in `/docs/adrs/`
- Named with a number and descriptive title
- Maintained in a timeline in the ADR README
- Never modified after acceptance (new ADRs supersede old ones)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear historical record of decisions
- Improved onboarding for new team members
- Reduced time spent on repeated discussions
- Better understanding of system evolution

### Negative

- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain

### Neutral

- Decisions become more formal and require more thought upfront

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Wiki-based documentation**: Rejected because wikis tend to become outdated and lack version control
2. **Inline code comments**: Rejected because they don't capture the full context and alternatives
3. **No formal process**: Rejected because it leads to lost context and repeated discussions
