3. **Maintainability**: Consider long-term maintenance in all decisions
4. **Security**: Security is not optional; it's built-in from the start

## Enforcement

These guidelines are enforced through:
- Code review process
- Automated linting and formatting
- CI/CD pipeline checks
- Regular team discussions and updates
