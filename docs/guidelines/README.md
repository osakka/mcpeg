## Core Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase
2. **Clarity**: Write code and documentation for humans first
3. **Maintainability**: Consider long-term maintenance in all decisions
4. **Security**: Security is not optional; it's built-in from the start

## Enforcement

These guidelines are enforced through:
- Code review process
- Automated linting and formatting
- CI/CD pipeline checks
- Regular team discussions and updates

## Contributing to Guidelines

Guidelines evolve with the project. To propose changes:
1. Create an ADR if the change is architectural
2. Discuss with the team
3. Update the relevant guideline document
4. Ensure all team members are aware of changes
